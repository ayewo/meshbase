# MeshBase
## Abstract
MeshBase is an unusual kind of [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). It is a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network#Peer-to-peer_CDNs) CDN designed to serve end users in markets that lack affordable high-speed Internet connections. Rather than build out its own infrastructure, which is a costly endeavor, it seeks to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure in those markets by leveraging resource sharing. 

CDNs enable spatial distribution of content to end users -- they allow download requests for content to be fulfilled by servers that are geographically close to the location of the requesting end user. This approach to content distribution allows download requests to complete faster, reduces bandwidth costs and increases the likelihood that the content will be available for consumption in future. 

In other words, CDNs enable quick, cheap and reliable delivery of content to end users, but for end users to enjoy these triple benefits, significant amounts of capital need to be committed upfront to build out a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and data centers. Such infrastructure investments are sorely lacking in emerging markets where cheap capital is less plentiful and low productivity is widespread.  

The whitepaper will examine content delivery within academic communities in emerging markets, specifically: enabling shared access to high-bandwidth educational content like video recordings of lectures from MOOCs that freely permit redistribution under a permissive license to African learners.
